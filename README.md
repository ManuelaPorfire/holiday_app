# holiday_app
Together with my boyfriend, Dragos Stefan Pop, who is a .Net developer, we tried to create a web application that allows companies to manage their employeeâ€™s holiday requests.  
This project represents a practical experience for me, and help me to see how a software company creates and tests an application. 
We tried to work AGILE as much as we could and we used trello.com to be able to track our tasks.
For source control we used githug.com where we committed our developed code and test cases.
My contribution was to:
-	Create specifications document
-	Create tickets in trello ticketing board
-	Create test cases
-	Manual testing of the application
-	Create automation tests
-	Bug Reporting
